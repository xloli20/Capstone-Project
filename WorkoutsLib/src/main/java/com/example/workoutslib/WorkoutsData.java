Your arms are bent and directly below the shoulder.Keep your body straight at all times, and hold this position as long as possible. To increase difficulty, an arm or leg can be raised.\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":\\\"2\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Pushups\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/46000/46831m.mp4\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/70/Female/m/70_2.jpg\\\",\\\"instruction\\\":\\\"Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart while holding your torso up at arms length. Next, lower yourself downward until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. Now breathe out and press your upper body back up to the starting position while squeezing your chest. After a brief pause at the top contracted position, you can begin to lower yourself downward again for as many repetitions as needed.\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":\\\"3\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Decline Reverse Crunch\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/44000/44731m.mp4\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/194/Female/m/194_2.jpg\\\",\\\"instruction\\\":\\\"Lie on your back on a decline bench and hold on to the top of the bench with both hands. Don\\'t let your body slip down from this position. Hold your legs parallel to the floor using your abs to hold them there while keeping your knees and feet together. Tip: Your legs should be fully extended with a slight bend on the knee. This will be your starting position. While exhaling, move your legs towards the torso as you roll your pelvis backwards and you raise your hips off the bench. At the end of this movement your knees will be touching your chest. Hold the contraction for a second and move your legs back to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":\\\"4\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Triceps Dips\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/44000/44761m.mp4\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/55/Female/m/55_1.jpg\\\",\\\"instruction\\\":\\\"To get into the starting position, hold your body at arm\\'s length with your arms nearly locked above the bars. Now, inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm. Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":\\\"5\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Cross-Body Crunch\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/44000/44621m.mp4\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/124/Female/m/124_2.jpg\\\",\\\"instruction\\\":\\\"Lie flat on your back and bend your knees about 60 degrees. Keep your feet flat on the floor and place your hands loosely behind your head. This will be your starting position. Now curl up and bring your right elbow and shoulder across your body while bring your left knee in toward your left shoulder at the same time. Reach with your elbow and try to touch your knee. Exhale as you perform this movement. Tip: Try to bring your shoulder up towards your knee rather than just your elbow and remember that the key is to contract the abs as you perform the movement; not just to move the elbow. Now go back down to the starting position as you inhale and repeat with the left elbow and the right knee. Continue alternating in this manner until all prescribed repetitions are done.\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":\\\"6\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Bodyweight Lunge\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/120000/120621m.mp4\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/4461/Female/m/4461_2.jpg\\\",\\\"instruction\\\":\\\"Stand erect with your feet hip-width apart, chest out, and shoulders back, maintaining the natural curvature of your spine. Your knees should be unlocked and your hand on your hips. This is your starting position. Take a moderate-length step forward with one foot, descending to a point in which your rear knee approaches the floor without touching, maintaining your body\\'s upright posture. Your front knee should bend about 90 degrees, but for knee health it should not be forward of the vertical plane that extends straight up from your toes. If so, take a slightly longer step. From the bottom position, push back up from your forward foot, bringing it back beside the other. Repeat on the opposite side for the required number of repetitions.\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":\\\"7\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Groiners\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/60000/61472m.mp4\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/592/Female/m/592_1.jpg\\\",\\\"instruction\\\":\\\"Begin in a pushup position on the floor. This will be your starting position. Using both legs, jump forward landing with your feet next to your hands. Keep your head up as you do so. Return to the starting position and immediately repeat the movement, continuing for 10-20 repetitions.\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":\\\"8\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Clam\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/116000/116572m.mp4\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/2843/Female/m/2843_1.jpg\\\",\\\"instruction\\\":\\\"Begin by lying on your side on the ground. Support your head on your left arm. Flex the hips to 45 degrees and the knees to approximately 90 degrees, with your right leg directly on top of your left. This will be your starting position. Initiate the exercise by abducting your right leg, pushing your knee away from the midline of your body. Maintain contact between your feet throughout the movement. Pause at the top of the motion, and then return to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. Do both sides.\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":\\\"9\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Bench Dips\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/44000/44141m.mp4\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/344/Female/m/344_2.jpg\\\",\\\"instruction\\\":\\\"For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back. With the bench perpendicular to your body, and while looking away from it, hold on to the bench on its edge with the hands fully extended, separated at shoulder width. The legs will be extended forward, bent at the waist and perpendicular to your torso. This will be your starting position. Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down. Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\\\"}]}";
